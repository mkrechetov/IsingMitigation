This is the code that supports paper "Prediction and Prevention of Pandemics via Graphical Model Inference and Convex Programming": https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.04517.

Below, is the content description:<br/>
"Cascades.ipynb" - here we illustrate the Cascade (SIR) model.<br/>
"Phases-d" and "Phases--m" notebooks that support the two-mode assumption and show the proportion of mixed states in different families of random graphs.<br/>
"Projecting.ipynb" - reproduces l_1 projection to the Safe Polytope.<br/>
"Projecting_OR-Tools_(Chicago).ipynb" - an experiment with l1 projection for the Chicago travel numbers (300 nodes).<br/>
"Projecting_OR-Tools_(NewYork).ipynb" - an experiment with l1 projection for the NewYork travel numbers (300 nodes).<br/>
